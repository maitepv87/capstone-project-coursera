# Little Lemon Capstone Project

Final project for the Meta Frontend Developer Specialization on Coursera.

This React-based application lays the groundwork for a table reservation feature on the Little Lemon restaurant website. The project starts from a customized boilerplate, with a cleaned structure and developer tooling optimized for clarity, modularity, and workflow efficiency.

## Key Features
- React project initialized via `create-react-app`
- Removal of default boilerplate elements (`App.js`, `logo.svg`)
- Modular structure prepared for reservation functionality
- VS Code extensions configured for a smoother dev experience:
  - ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
  - `Auto Rename Tag` for paired tag editing
  - `Trailing Spaces` for whitespace hygiene

## Getting Started
Clone the repo, run `npm install`, and launch with `npm start`.
