# Little Lemon Capstone Project

Final project for the Meta Frontend Developer Specialization on Coursera.

This React-based application lays the groundwork for a table reservation feature on the Little Lemon restaurant website. The project starts from a customized boilerplate, with a cleaned structure and developer tooling optimized for clarity, modularity, and workflow efficiency.

## Key Features

- React project initialized via `create-react-app`
- Removal of default boilerplate elements (`App.js`, `logo.svg`)
- Modular structure prepared for reservation functionality
- VS Code extensions configured for a smoother dev experience:

  - ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
  - `Auto Rename Tag` for paired tag editing
  - `Trailing Spaces` for whitespace hygiene

### âœ… Semantic HTML Foundation

This project fulfills the semantic layout exercise by:

- Replacing non-semantic root `<div>` with a React fragment
- Structuring the app with semantic tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
- Modularizing each section into reusable components
- Adding accessible navigation using `NavLink` and `aria-label`
- Including brand logo with descriptive `alt` text
- Wrapping routed content inside `<main>` for clarity and accessibility
- Providing editorial closure in `<footer>`

This structure improves onboarding, accessibility, and emotional clarity across the app.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, run `npm install`, and launch with `npm start`.
