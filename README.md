# Little Lemon Capstone Project

Final project for the Meta Frontend Developer Specialization on Coursera.

This React-based application lays the groundwork for a table reservation feature on the Little Lemon restaurant website. The project starts from a customized boilerplate, with a cleaned structure and developer tooling optimized for clarity, modularity, and workflow efficiency.

## Key Features

- React project initialized via `create-react-app`
- Removal of default boilerplate elements (`App.js`, `logo.svg`)
- Modular structure prepared for reservation functionality
- VS Code extensions configured for a smoother dev experience:

  - ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
  - `Auto Rename Tag` for paired tag editing
  - `Trailing Spaces` for whitespace hygiene

### ‚úÖ Semantic HTML Foundation

This project fulfills the semantic layout exercise by:

- Replacing non-semantic root `<div>` with a React fragment
- Structuring the app with semantic tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
- Modularizing each section into reusable components
- Adding accessible navigation using `NavLink` and `aria-label`
- Including brand logo with descriptive `alt` text
- Wrapping routed content inside `<main>` for clarity and accessibility
- Providing editorial closure in `<footer>`

This structure improves onboarding, accessibility, and emotional clarity across the app.

### üåê Metadata & Open Graph Optimization

The `index.html` file includes semantic and editorial metadata to support SEO and social sharing:

- `description`, `author`, and `keywords` for search engine clarity
- Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`) for rich previews on social platforms
- Uses `%PUBLIC_URL%` for build-safe asset referencing
- Editorial tone aligned with brand voice and Mediterranean warmth

This setup ensures the app appears correctly across search engines, social media, and mobile devices.

## üß± CSS Layout Setup

This layout system transforms wireframes into responsive, reusable sections using semantic HTML and Flexbox. It adapts fluidly across devices, ensuring clarity and warmth.

### ‚úÖ Key Decisions

- Flexbox layout with `gap`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`
- Media queries at `768px` for mobile stacking
- Relative units (`rem`, `%`, `vh`) for fluid scaling
- Modular CSS per component + shared rules in `layout.css`

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, run `npm install`, and launch with `npm start`.
